# Risk-Factor-Model-Estimation
This tutorial serves as an introduction to quantitative finance and how to estimate the Fama French Carhart four-factor risk model exposures for an arbitrary stock using live data in Python. This project covers the process and common pitfalls of pulling live data from the Fama-French risk factor database and from Yahoo Finance and running a factor sensitivity estimation using linear regression.

# Theory
The Carhart 4-factor model builds upon the Fama-French factor model, which is a 3-factor model including the size of firms (Small Minus Big - SMB), the value premium (High Minus Low - HML), and excess return on the market (the portfolio's return less the risk-free rate of return). The additional factor in the Carhart model is momentum (MOM). 

The idea of evaluating a stock based on these four factors is to better understand differences in its expected returns the amount of risk carried by a portfolio. Ultimately, one can build a strategy around the findings to build a portfolio, which is the basis of factor investing.
